The goal of dyn.log is to be a comprehensive and dynamic configuration driven logging package
for R. While there are several excellent logging solutions already in the R ecosystem, I always
feel constrained in some way by each of them. Every project is designed differently to achieve its stated goal;
to solve some problem, and ultimately the utility of a logging solution is its ability to adapt
to the project’s design. This is the rai·son d'ê·tre for dyn.log, to provide a modular design, 
template mechanics and a configuration-based integration model, so that the logger can integrate 
deeply into your design, even though it knows nothing about it.

## Installation

#### GitHub

You can install the development version of dyn.log from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
remotes::install_github("bmoretz/dyn.log")
```

#### CRAN

You can install the latest stable version of dyn.log from CRAN:

(coming soon)

## Overview

Since everything about dyn.log is configuration driven, the package comes with a basic configuration **default.yaml**:

```yaml
`r xfun::file_string('inst/default.yaml')`
```

The *settings* node contains the core settings of the log dispatcher, by attribute.

The *levels* node contains the log levels you want to have in your environment. You'll notice
that **log_style** and **msg_style** are [crayon](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) styles. This is
because each level has a unique render format that helps to visually assist parsing of log information.

The logging functionality is exposed by a R6 class, *LogDispatch*, that is available as a package
namespace variable called **Logger**. The **Logger** will have methods that correspond to the *log levels*
that are defined in its yaml configuration, which makes logging intuitive. When the package is loaded,
the logger will appear in the top / global environment as *Logger*.

Log messages are automatically assumed to be in standard [glue](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue) format
so local environment variables are capturable in the log output.

## Simple Example

```{r color, echo = FALSE}
options(crayon.enabled = TRUE)
knitr::knit_hooks$set(message = function(x, options){
  paste0(
    "<pre class=\"console-out\"><code>",
    fansi::sgr_to_html(x = x, warn = FALSE),
    "</code></pre>"
  )
})
```

The following example wraps the logger call in *capture.output* and *message* so that the
[crayon](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) styles are shown correctly in markdown.

```{r simple_example, eval=F}
library(dyn.log)

var1 <- "abc"; var2 <- 123; var3 <- runif(1)

Logger$debug("my log message - var1: {var1}, var2: {var2}, var3: {var3}")

```

### Standard Log Levels & Styles

The default configuration (above) defines the following "standard" log levels, 
and their output can be seen in the below screenshot:

### Customizing a Log Message

Log message layouts are exposed as an S3 type in the package called *log_layout*. Layouts are
composed from a series of objects that inherit from *fmt_layout*.

```{r, customized_layout, eval=F}

new_log_layout(
    new_fmt_metric(crayon::green$bold, "sysname"),
    new_fmt_metric(crayon::red$bold, "release"),
    new_fmt_line_break(),
    new_fmt_log_level(),
    new_fmt_timestamp(crayon::silver$italic),
    new_fmt_log_msg(),
    seperator = '-',
    association = "default"
  )

Logger$info("my log message - var1: {var1}, var2: {var2}, var3: {var3}")

```
![Custom Log Layout](man/figures/README-custom-log-output.PNG)

For a detailed look at these objects, and how they work please see the "Log Layouts" *vignette*.

> (vignette("Log Layouts", package = "dyn.log")

### Logging Associations

One thing you may have noticed about the previous log layout definition was the *association* parameter. Associations
are a useful way to build a customized log layout for your custom R6 types. This can be especially useful in larger applications, such as [plumber](https://github.com/rstudio/plumber/) services or [shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) dashboards.

A TestObject is defined as below, who's primary responsibly is to assign a randomly generated identifier to
the instance via the constructor. There is also a method on the object that will call the logger with some
local scope variables that should be logged as well.

```{r, test_obj_def, eval=FALSE}
TestObject <- R6::R6Class(
  classname = "TestObject",

  public = list(
    id = NULL,

    initialize = function() {
      self$id <- private$generate_id()
    },

    test_trace = function() {
      a <- "test"; b <- 123; c <- runif(1)

      Logger$info("these are some variables: {a} - {b} - {c}")
    }
  ),

  private = list(
    generate_id = function(n = 15) {
      paste0(sample(LETTERS, n, TRUE), collapse =  '')
    }
  )
)

```

With the above class defined, we can create a custom log layout that associated with this R6 type with
a new log layout:

```{r, cls_assocation, eval=F}

  new_log_layout(
    new_fmt_literal(crayon::cyan$bold, "Object Id:"),
    new_fmt_cls_field(crayon::bgCyan$silver$bold, "id"),
    new_fmt_line_break(),
    new_fmt_log_level(),
    new_fmt_timestamp(crayon::silver$italic),
    new_fmt_log_msg(),
    new_fmt_line_break(),
    new_fmt_metric(crayon::green$bold, "sysname"),
    new_fmt_metric(crayon::red$bold, "nodename"),
    new_fmt_literal(crayon::blue$bold, "R Version:"),
    new_fmt_metric(crayon::blue$italic$bold, "r_ver"),
    new_fmt_line_break(),
    association = "TestObject"
  )

  obj$test_trace()
    
  Logger$debug("this is a normal log msg")
```
![Class Level Associations](man/figures/README-cls-association-output.PNG)

As you can see, only when the logger is invoked from inside the class that has a custom layout associated with it
does the custom layout get used. The follow-up log call (outside the class scope) reverts back to the standard
layout settings.

For a detailed look at class associations, and how they work please see the "Log Layouts" *vignette*.
