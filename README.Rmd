# dyn.log

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dyn.log is to be a comprehensive and dynamic configuration driven logging package
for R. While there are several excellent logging solutions already in the R ecosystem, I always
feel constrained in some way by each of them. Every project is designed differently to achieve its stated goal;
to solve some problem, and ultimately the utility of a logging solution is its ability to adapt
to the project’s design. This is the rai·son d'ê·tre for dyn.log, to provide a modular design, 
template mechanics and a configuration-based integration model, so that the logger can integrate 
deeply into your design, even though it knows nothing about it.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dyn.log from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("bmoretz/dyn.log")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dyn.log)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
