Description: A comprehensive and dynamic configuration driven logging package for R. While there 
    are several excellent logging solutions already in the R ecosystem, I always feel constrained 
    in some way by each of them. Every project is designed differently to achieve its stated goal; 
    to solve some problem, and ultimately the utility of a logging solution is its ability to adapt 
    to the project’s design. This is the rai·son d'ê·tre for dyn.log, to provide a modular design, 
    template mechanics and a configuration-based integration model, so that the logger can integrate 
    deeply into your design, even though it knows nothing about it.
